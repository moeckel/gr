<p>This is the website for the open-source package to create gradual rastercells. An early description of this methodology was published as a conference paper at the Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board:</p>
<p class="highlight">Moeckel, R., Donnelly, R. (2014) Gradual Rasterization: Redefining the spatial resolution in transport modeling. In: Proceedings of the 93rd Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board (TRB). Washington, D.C. January 12-16, 2014. [<a href="http://moeckel.github.io/rm/doc/2014_moeckel_donnelly_trb.pdf">Download</a>]<br>
</p>
<p>A largely revised version is currently under review for publication in <a href="http://www.envplan.com/B.html">Environment and Planning B</a>. </p>

<p>The deliverable contains a compiled executable called rasterizeI75.exe (for PC only). Three subdirectories are included:</p>
<li>
<strong>code:</strong> In this directory, you find the Fortran source code. It has been compiled with ï»¿Intel(R) Visual Fortran Composer XE 2013 SP1 to create the executable (rasterizeI75.exe). This code is not neede to run the model, but has been provided to enable programmers to understand every step of the model. </li>
<li>
<strong>data:</strong> This directory has all input data that is read by the program (rasterizeI75.exe). The program also writes additional files to this directory while running. </li>
<li>
<strong>shp:</strong> This directory provides a shapefile of zones in the Geogia study area. </li>
<p><br>After downloading the executable and the the two directories /data and /shp (downloading the directory /code is optional), open a command prompt window, navigate to the directory where you saved these files and open rasterizeI75.exe. The model will run through a series of steps to create a raster zone system and to disaggregate auto and truck flows of the Georgia Statewide Transportation Model from zones to raster cells.

<p>The model was designed by Rick Donnelly (Parsons Brinckerhoff) and Rolf Moeckel (formerly Parsons Brinckerhoff, now University of Maryland). The code was written by Rolf Moeckel.</p>
